-  I learned a lot about using node sass, it was hard to get it ready to work at the first time because I never used it in my past projects. What I really liked about this project was using scss, so fun, I only new how to style a page using css before this project but now scss is a great tool to have in the pocket, it saves you tones of times. What is nice about scss is that you can impliment those cool things that could not do in css. With scss you can use css variable, mixing, function, and son fourth.
-  I started to use I little bit of javascript in this project of which I am proud.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Figma
- Figma Font Helper

## Install

We'll be using `node-sass` for our Sass compilation. Let's install that by doing:

1. `npm i`

## Getting started

### Design

You can find the design:

- online at [figma.com/Laaqiq-1-Portfolio-detail-Responsive](https://www.figma.com/file/VgF87mULloYb7HZ1EMCRzU/Laaqiq-1-Portfolio-detail-Responsive?node-id=0%3A1) (Recommended)
- by importing the `.fig` file in [the `source_materials` folder](./source_materials/) into your figma app.

### Sass

## How To Use
We'll be using the `scss` folder for all our Sass files.
<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/your-project-name

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
